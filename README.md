## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I chose Airbnb New York City in 2019 complete hotels dataset. 

As a travler fan,  it would be quite interesting to apply data analysis skills here. 

My key interests would be:

1. Which neighborhood_group has the highest price?
2. What are the reviews per month of the neighbourhood_group?
3. What is the percentage of available room less than 30 days?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
Data.csv contains lastest edition FIFA 2019 players attributes including host_name, neighbourhood_group, price, etc

There is also a notebook available here to showcsae all my work related to my three questions.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the [post](https://medium.com/@queena.qmx/what-is-airbnb-new-york-city-2019-analysis-report-2bc51b822455) available
