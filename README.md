# AB_NYC_2019_ANALYSIT_REPORT
##What is AB_NYC_2019_ANALYSIT_REPORT?
This is a program that I analysit 3 questions about Airbnb in NEWW York City in 2019(The datasets from Kaggle).

##These are questions:

*  Which neighborhood_group has the highest price?

* As expected, Manhattan has the highest rates and the Bronx has the lowest rates. 
* Look at this figure we got courtesy of archinect.com:

* As you can see, the ratios are fairly similar. You could deduce from the two figures that Airbnb rates are proportional to real estate prices. This really isn't a surprise considering that real estate owners have to charge enough money to offset the losses from owning the property.

*  What are the reviews per month of the neighbourhood_group?

*  What is the percentage of available room less than 30 days?
'The percentage of available room less than 30 days is 0.46423969731056347'
